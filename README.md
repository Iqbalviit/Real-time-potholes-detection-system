# Real-time-potholes-detection-system
The initial phases of our project have culminated in substantial achievements. We have diligently collected and meticulously annotated a comprehensive dataset of road images, incorporating various instances of potholes. The work on a Dataset is Done from both ML and DL algorithms. The ML algorithms selected for execution are Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM. The Later selection of the Faster R-CNN deep learning model reflects our commitment to object detection precision. By employing data preprocessing techniques, such as resizing and augmentation, we have optimized our dataset for effective model training. Subsequent training and fine-tuning of the chosen model have enabled us to attain commendable accuracy in pothole detection.
After KNN performs best among rest of the algorithms , therefore KNN was used to detect potholes in the images of the dataset and In the last, as a final step a real time pothloes detection code were writtern executed and tested.
